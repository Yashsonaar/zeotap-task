# 📊 eCommerce Transactions Analysis

Welcome to the repository for the **eCommerce Transactions Analysis** project! This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA), building predictive models, and clustering techniques to derive actionable business insights from an eCommerce dataset. 🚀

---

## 📝 Project Overview

The analysis focuses on three primary tasks:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Business Insights**:
   - Analyzing customer behavior, product trends, and sales patterns.
   - Deriving insights to improve business strategies.
2. **Lookalike Model**:
   - Recommending similar customers based on their profiles and transaction history.
3. **Customer Segmentation**:
   - Clustering customers into distinct groups for targeted marketing.
